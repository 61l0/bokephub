== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**How many popups can I create?**

You can create as many popups as you want, there is no limit either on the Free or the PRO version.

**Can I have more than one popup on the same page?**

You can have as many popups as you want on the same page, but you can only set one popup to be opened on page load, the others must be set to open on click.

**How can I set a popup to open automatically?**

After creating your popup, go to the desired page or post and you will see a meta box below the content editor, with the following title: "Select popup on page load". Select the popup you want to set and then update the page. You are done! After you go to that page/post the popup will get opened automatically.

**Want to insert a popup on a link, that will open up when clicked on the link?**

Simply add the following class to it: sg-confirm-popup-#popupid.
Ex. `<a href="https://sygnoos.com/" class="sg-confirm-popup-1">Popup</a>`
This will open a popup before a user goes to the page from the link.

**Want to open your links inside the popup without redirecting your users to the other site? (PRO)**

You can simply create an empty iframe popup and add the following class to your link: sg-iframe-popup-#popupid number.
Ex. `<a href="https://sygnoos.com/" class="sg-iframe-popup-1">Popup</a>`
This way, you'll have an iframe popup on your link, so when a user clicks on your link an iframe popup will open up, with the page of the link inside, so the users won't be redirected by the link.

**Can I put a popup to show after clicking something?**

Yes. There is an "Insert popup" button which will insert the popup shortcode over any element (text, image, button, etc.) you want. Just select the element, click on the button, choose a popup and you are done!

Ex. [sg_popup id="1" event="click"]Your text, or HTML element[/sg_popup]

Ex. [sg_popup id="1" event="click" wrap="span"]Your text, which will be wraped inside span element[/sg_popup]

Ex. [sg_popup id="1" event="click"]`<img src="https://sygnoos.com/images/sygnoos_logo_grey.png">`[/sg_popup]

Alternative method in case if shortcode doesn't satisfy your needs 

Adding the following class `sg-popup-id-1`

**Can I change the wrapping element of onclick popup?**

Yes, you can change it. You can write any HTML element you need to wrap your content in the wrapper attribute of your onclick popup.

= HTML Popup =

While sharing your ideas and viewpoints online, it is not always convenient and/or adequate to include in the given text all the info you've got. On the other hand, it may be rather important not to ignore the possible extra pieces of information, especially if you aim to satisfy the needs of a manifold audience. But how can this be achieved? Is there a correspondent tool for it? 
The HTML popup we offer is quite a popular solution. Having installed it, you are enabled to be brief but share a pack of information if you wish. All kind of associations connected with any part of your material can be presented with the help of a simple redirection.
There are several options' sections available where you can configure the popup up to your needs. First you can see about the way the popup looks by choosing the theme and effect types applied to it and deciding the appropriate dimensions. Then, you are able to manage when and where the popup turns up. It can appear while scrolling the page, remain unchangeable or be resized according to the window. Meanwhile, the popup can be chosen to close either automatically or by hand. Also, you can decide on its availability on different devices (PC, mobile, etc.).

You are writing about an awesome topic and want your ideas to stand out in the crowd? Well, you can easily do it by making use of an image popup thus adding a topic image to the plot.
The installed image popup allows to determine the image dimensions, which, in its turn, are resized/repositioned automatically when the window is being resized. This popup provides options for choosing the image frame theme and effects that vary in the duration of the popup animation as well. There is also the possibility to specify how long the ready-made popup appearance should be delayed after loading the page (in sec).
With the help of both basic and advanced options, you are able to freely regulate the dismissal, display, color and location of the image popup. It can appear at the top right/left corner, at the bottom or in the center. You can choose to show the popup whenever the user scrolls the page or ensure its permanent occurrence by disabling popup closing in any possible way. On the other hand, the popup can be chosen to close automatically, be dismissed when the user clicks inside or beyond of the popup area. Also, it's up to you to decide on your popup accessibility on different devices (PC, mobile, etc.).

Besides having the ability to add a short code into the popup, it is also possible to manage the popup development with the help of different options available.

= Exit-Intent Popup =

The exit-intent popup technologies we offer can detect when your visitors are about to push the back button, close their browser, or navigate away and they can appear as a popup addressed to them. These popups are "overlay popups", and cannot be blocked by popup blockers. Also, they are the most customer-friendly approach to communicate a special message to your visitors, as they don't interrupt your visitors while browsing or scanning your site. Thus, you will be able to easily draw their attention to sales, special offers and contests. If you decide to make use of targeted audience, you'd better consider those of a particular social network you get a lot of traffic from. Another thing you will be able to do is to grab email addresses by offering an incentive to subscribe.

We suggest installing this countdown popup that helps to present your content and keep people anticipating for it, as the popup gives information and shows the time left for reaching it at the same time.
While building up the popup, you are able to attach any kind of media or textual material. Moreover, you can control its look by choosing the popup theme and the accompanying effect. The way the counter is displayed is also manageable, since you can choose the counter background colour, text colour and language, countdown format, time zone and the location of the counter in the popup.
