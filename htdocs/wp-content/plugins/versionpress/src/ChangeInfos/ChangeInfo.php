 * {@link VersionPress\ChangeInfos\EntityChangeInfo}s the initiator is usually some
 * {@link VersionPress\Storages\Storage}). The ChangeInfo is then persisted to a commit message by {@link Committer}
 * and later reconstructed from it again when the main VersionPress table is being displayed (see admin/index.php
 * and {@link VersionPress\ChangeInfos\ChangeInfoFactory}).
 *
 * There are two main classes of ChangeInfo objects: tracked and untracked ones, and the tracked change infos
 * further have many specific types to represent various actions (for instance, post changes display different
 * messages than comment messages). More docs on it in {@link VersionPress\ChangeInfos\TrackedChangeInfo}.
