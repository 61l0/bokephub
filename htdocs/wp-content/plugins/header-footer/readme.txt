Header and Footer plugin let you to add html code to the head and footer sections of your blog... and more!

== Description ==

About WordPress SEO and Facebook Open Graph: I was very unpleased by Yoast invitation to
remove my plugin, and it's not the case.

= Head and Footer Codes =

Why you have to install 10 plugins to add Google Analytics code, custom
tracking code, Google Webmaster/Alexa/Bing/Tradedoubler verificaton code (and so on...) 
on head of footer section of your blog pages?

With Header and Footer plugin you can just copy the code those services give you
in a centralized point to manage them all.

* manage the head section code
* manage the footer code
* manage the facebook og:image tag
* recognize and execute PHP code to add logic
* few SEO options
* mobile detection

= Post Top and Bottom Codes =

Do you need to inject a banner over the post content or after it? No problem. With Header and
Footer you can:

* Add codes on top, bottom and in the middle of posts and pages
* Differentiate between mobile and desktop (you don't display the same ad format on both, true?)
* Separable post and page configuration
* Native PHP code enabled
* Shortcodes enbaled

= Special Injections =

* Just after the opening BODY tag
* In the middle of post content (using configurable rules)
* Everywhere on template (using placeholders)

= Limits =

This plugin cannot change the menu or the footer layout, those features must be covered by your theme!
