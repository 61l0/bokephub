	<p>This documentation is was written to help new WordPress Move users start using the plugin faster and more efficiently. Even though the plugin is designed to be as straightforward as possible, it may still be confusing for new users. It is highly recommended that you read this documentation before using the plugin. You can find the list of topics covered in this documentation below.</p>

	<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
	<p>Installing WordPress Move is no different than other plugins. You can either download the plugin from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/" title="WordPress Plugin Directory">WordPress Plugin Directory</a> and install it manually or use the search feature on the Install Plugin page.</p>
	<p>There are actually two different types of manual installations. For both of them, first you need to download the plugin in .zip format from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/" title="WordPress Plugin Directory">WordPress Plugin Directory</a>. Then you can follow one of the manual installation methods explained below.</p>
	<p>The first way is using the Upload tab on the Install Plugin page. To begin, please navigate to <code>Administration Panel &rarr; Plugins &rarr; Add New &rarr; Upload</code> to upload the .zip file you have just downloaded. Once you select the file to upload from your computer and click the Install Now button, WordPress will automatically install the plugin for you.</p>
	<p>The second way is uploading the contents of the .zip file you have just downloaded to <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory using your FTP client. Do not forget that you need to upload the directory inside the .zip file not the .zip file itself. For further instructions on uploading files using your FTP client, please refer to the documentation of your FTP client.</p>
	<p>The easiest way to install the plugin, however, is using the Search feature on the Install Plugin page. To begin, please navigate to <code>Administration Panel &rarr; Plugins &rarr; Add New</code> where you can search for the plugin by typing WordPress Move to the textbox and clicking the Search Plugins button. Then, on the search results page, please click the Install Now link displayed under the name of the plugin to begin installing the plugin.</p>
	<p>After following one of these three methods, please navigate to <code>Administration Panel &rarr; Plugins &rarr; Installed Plugins</code> page and activate the plugin using the Activate link display right under the name of the plugin. Once you see the <code>Plugin activated.</code> notification at the top, you are ready to start using the plugin.</p>
	<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
	<p>Once you activated WordPress Move, it added 3 pages to your Administration Panel: Migration Assistant, Backup Manager and WordPress Move. First two are located under the Tools menu while the last one is located under the Settings menu. To configure the plugin, you need to navigate to WordPress Move page under the Settings menu. Before diving into configuring the plugin, please note that configuration is only necessary if you are planning to use the plugin to migrate to another server. In other words, you do not need any configuration if you are only going to use the plugin to change the domain name of your existing installation. or complete the migration started from another server. Also, if you are planning to use the plugin to migrate your existing installation to another server, first you need to install WordPress and WordPress Move on the remote server as well before continuing.</p>
	<p>If you have successfully completed installing WordPress and WordPress Move on the remote server, please navigate to WordPress Move Settings page, where you will see eight settings under three titles.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First set of settings are used to connect to the server you want to migrate to. Most probably you are already familiar with the first four settings but if you are not, it might be a good idea to request some assistance from your hosting company to obtain these details. Once you obtain them, please fill in these settings. Now, to fill in the next setting, Remote Backup Path, you need to know the exact path to the directory you have WordPress installed on the remote server. The easiest way to learn this is using an FTP client to connect the server and navigating to the directory where WordPress is installed. Once you get there, copy the path and paste it to the Remote Backup Path setting field on the settings page of the plugin. Then, append the following to that path: <code>/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-move/backup/</code>. The reason why this is not automatically appended by the plugin is to give power users the ability to change the backup directory with two small alterations (the other is changing the <code>WPMOVE_BACKUP_DIR</code> constant on wordpress-move.php file). The last setting in this set is the Passive Mode setting. If you do not know what to set, please leave it as is and toggle if you experience issues with connecting to the remote server.</li>
		<li>The second set of settings is Database Backup Settings which consists of only one setting that defines the chunk size of the database backup that will be created, in megabytes. Please type 0 to create the database backup as a single file.</li>
		<li>The third set of settings is File Backup Settings which consists of only one setting that defines the size of files to compress per filesystem backup chunk, in megabytes. Please type 0 to create the filesystem backup as a single file.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now you are ready to start the migration by going to the Migration Assistant page under the Tools menu.</p>
	<h2 id="using">Using The Plugin</h2>
	<p>Using the plugin is fairly simple. If you want to change your domain name, start migrating to another server or complete the migration you have already started from another server, you need to navigate to Migration Assistant page under the tools menu. However, if you want to manage the backup files under the backup directory, you need to navigate to Backup Manager page under the tools menu.</p>
	<h2 id="assistant">Migration Assistant</h2>
	<p>Migration Assistant welcomes you with three different actions you may want to perform: Change Domain Name, Start Migration and Restore. If you wish to only change the domain name of your current installation, you should click the Change Domain Name link. If you wish to migrate to another server, you should click the Start Migration link. Once again, do not forget that you need to configure the plugin by going to WordPress Move page under the Settings menu before starting the migration. And finally, if you wish to complete the migration process started from another server, click the Complete Migration link.</p>
		<h3 id="domain">Change Domain Name</h3>
		<p>Changing the domain name that your current installation operates on is quite easy. Just type in the new domain name you want to use instead of the current domain name and click the Change button. Plugin will immediately change all instances of your old domain name in the database with your new domain name. WordPress Move also backups your database before starting the operation so if something goes wrong, it rolls back all the changes made. Of course, rolling back may also fail under some circumstances so creating a backup of your database manually beforehand is always a good idea. WordPress Move actually saves the backup file it creates beforehand to the old backup directory in case something goes wrong either during the domain name changing procedure or afterwards. Note that database backup files WordPress Move creates are not like normal database backup files, so you will need a working instance of WordPress Move on that server to be able to restore using those backup files. Still, creating a backup file yourself is highly encouraged. Do not forget that WordPress Move only replaces instances of your old domain name in the database with your new domain name and does not make any further configurations needed to make your domain work on your host. Please refer to the question in the FAQ section for some additional information about this.</p>
		<h3 id="migrate">Migrate</h3>
		<p>Migration page displays all the files under your WordPress installation directory and asks you which files to backup. Once you click the Start Migration button, it creates the backup of your database and the files (in chunks if you set a Chunk Size on the settings page of the plugin) you selected, and uploads them to the remote server. If you do not select any files, only a backup of your database will be uploaded to the server you want to migrate to. Also, the option to change the domain name that will be used on your new server is provided as well. It only changes the domain name that will be used by the installation in the receiving end. When starting the migration succeeds, you can run WordPress Move on the remote server in Complete Migration mode to complete the migration process.</p>
		<h3 id="restore">Restore</h3>
		<p>Restore option basically imports database backups and extracts filesystem backups, created and uploaded by WordPress Move on the server you want to migrate from. When you navigate to Restore page, it lists all the backup files inside the main backup directory aka Current Backups that you can choose from to complete the migration. Do not forget that this process does not create a backup of your existing installation so if something goes wrong, it will not be possible to rollback the changes. It is your responsibility to backup your files and the database before clicking the Complete Migration button. If there are no files listed on the Complete Migration page, please make sure you started the migration successfully using WordPress Move on the server you are migrating from.</p>
	<h2 id="backup">Backup Manager</h2>
	<p>Backup Manager is the place to organize the backup files either created by the plugin on the same server, or uploaded by the server you are migrating from. If this is the server you want to migrate from, you can delete backup files after the Migration Assistant completes uploading them to the remote server. If you do not want to delete them, you can Archive them which basically means moving them to a sub-directory called <code>old</code>. You can always Unarchive the files you Archived using the Backup Manager. Files listed under Current Backups are the files that will be used by the Complete Migration mode so you can either delete or achive the files you do not want Complete Migration to use. Files listed under the Old Backups section are not used for anything so you can safely Archive the backup files you do not want to use but also do not want to delete.</p>
	<p>Since version 1.3, there is also Converted Database Backups section where which lists the database backup files that can be used outside the WordPress Move. As you might have noticed, database backups generated by WordPress Move have a different structure than normal database backup files which is the reason why you cannot use them outside the WordPress Move. To use database backup file outside the WordPress Move, simply find it in either Current Backups or Old Backups section, select the checkbox on the left, select the Convert option from the dropdown and click the Apply button. This will convert the files you have selected into generic SQL files that you can use outside the plugin. This feature is particularly useful if the plugin fails to migrate your installation properly or if you need to use the database backup file outside the plugin.</p>
	<p>If you wish to download a backup file, you can click on its name. That way, if the plugin fails send your files to the server on the receiving end, you can easily download your backup files and upload them to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-move/backup/</code> directory on your new server. Once you finish uploading them, you can use the Restore method to finalize the migration operation.</p>
	<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>I am getting the "Could not activate the plugin because it generated a fatal error." error when I try to activate the plugin. Why?</strong>
		<br>WordPress Move needs php_sockets extension to be enabled, in order to work properly. If you are getting this error message, please enable php_sockets extension and restart your web server. Once you successfully enable the extension, you will be able to activate the plugin.</li>
		<li><strong>Do I need to install WordPress and WordPress Move on the new server as well, if I want to use WordPress Move for migration purposes?</strong>
		<br>Yes you do.</li>
		<li><strong>Is it possible to both migrate to another server and change the domain name?</strong>
		<br>Yes. You can choose whether you want to change your domain name or not on the migration screen. Note that it does not change the domain name used by the current installation, it just replaces instances of the old domain name with the new one on the fly while creating a database backup for migration.</li>
		<li><strong>Can I use WordPress Move to create backups of my installation?</strong>
		<br>Yes, you can. Click either <code>Create a Database Backup</code> button or <code>Create a Full Backup</code> button to create a backup. Your backup files will be stored under the backup directory. You can use Complete Migration mode whenever you want to use those files to revert to a former state of your installation.</li>
		<li><strong>Can I use WordPress Move to transfer my database backup only?</strong>
		<br>Yes, you can. All you need to do is selecting the Advanced Migration during the migration type selection page and not selecting any files when the file tree is displayed. Once you click the Start Migration button, the plugin will create a backup of your database only and transfer it to your new server. When you run WordPress Move on your new server in Complete Migration mode, the plugin will import the database backup created by your old WordPress installation.</li>
		<li><strong>Does WordPress Move take care of changing the whole domain name changing process?</strong>
		<br>No, it does not. WordPress Move just replaces instances of your old domain name in your database with the new domain name you provide. It is still your responsibility to point your domain name to the name servers used by your hosting company and make necessary configurations on the control panel provided by your hosting company. Before starting this process, please request assistance from your hosting company as some companies' systems erase all your data without creating backups when you change your domain name. Also, do not forget that it is always a good idea to have a backup of your files and the database before starting operations like these.</li>
		<li><strong>Plugin fails to create backup files because it says my backup directory is not writable. How can I fix this?</strong>
		<br>As the warning suggests, you need to make the backup directory writable by the plugin. Permission settings vary from server to server so there is no specific value to set the directory permissions to. The easiest way to fix this problem yourself is using an FTP client to alter permission settings of the backup directory until plugin successfully creates backup files. You may also prefer requesting assistance from your hosting company.</li>
		<li><strong>I am a pre-1.2 user, what will happen to the FTP Password that is already stored in my database?</strong>
		<br>Visiting the WordPress Move Settings page any time after updating the plugin will remove it from the database permanently.</li>
		<li><strong>Can I use the database backup files that WordPress Move generates with phpMyAdmin?</strong>
		<br>You can convert a database backup file using the Convert option in the Backup Manager to use it outside the plugin. So, yes, you can use the <strong>converted</strong> database backup files with phpMyAdmin or any other script.</li>
